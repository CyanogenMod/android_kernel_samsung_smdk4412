// The Delay() routine, in ISSP_Driver_Routines.c, has a delay of n+3 usec,
// where n is the value passed to the routine.  This is true for the m8c micro-
// processor in the PSoC when it is running at a CPU clock of 24MHz.
//
// PROCESSOR_SPECIFIC
// If another processor is used, or if the m8c is running at a slower clock
// speed, then the delay parameters will be different. This file makes changing
// the delays simpiler when porting the program to other processors.

// DELAY_M is the slope of the Delay = Mx + B equation
#define DELAY_M    1
// DELAY_B is the offset of the delay in Delay = Mx + B.
#define DELAY_B    3

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// CAUTION:
// For the above parameters the minimum delay value is 3 (this would result in
// 0 being passed for a minimum delay. A value less than 3 would actually
// create a negative number, causing a very long delay
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// TRANSITION_TIMEOUT is a loop counter for a 100msec timeout when waiting for
// a high-to-low transition. This is used in the polling loop of
// fDetectHiLoTransition(). Each pass through the loop takes approximately 15
