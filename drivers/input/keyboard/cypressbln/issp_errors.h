#define INC_ISSP_ERRORS

// The following are defines for error messages from the ISSP program.
#define PASS           0
// PASS is used to indicate that a function completed successfully.
#define ERROR         -1
// ERROR is a generic failure used within lower level functions before the
// error is reported.  This should not be seen as an error that is reported
// from main.
#define INIT_ERROR     1
// INIT_ERROR means a step in chip initialization failed.
#define SiID_ERROR     2
// SiID_ERROR means that the Silicon ID check failed. This happens if the
// target part does not match the device type that the ISSP program is
// configured for.
#define ERASE_ERROR    3
// ERASE_ERROR means that the bulk erase step failed. 
#define BLOCK_ERROR    4
// BLOCK_ERROR means that a step in programming a Flash block or the verify
// of the block failed.
#define VERIFY_ERROR   5
// VERIFY_ERROR means that the checksum verification failed.
#define SECURITY_ERROR 6
// SECURITY_ERROR means that the write of the security information failed.
