/** @brief OSK Mutual Exclusion Lock flags type
 *
 * Flags are supplied at the point where the Lock is initialized. Each flag can
 * be combined with others using bitwise OR, '|'.
 *
 * The flags must be sufficiently rich to cope with all our OSs. This means
 * that on some OSs, certain flags can be completely ignored. We define a
 * number of terms that are significant across all OSs:
 *
 * - Sleeping/non-sleeping mutexs. Sleeping mutexs can block on waiting, and so
 * schedule out the current thread. This is significant on OSs where there are
 * situations in which the current thread must not be put to sleep. On OSs
 * without this restriction, sleeping and non-sleeping mutexes can be treated
 * as the same (if that is required).
 * - Interruptable/non-interruptable mutexes. For sleeping mutexes, it may be
 * possible for the sleep to be interrupted for a reason other than the thread
 * being able to obtain the lock. OSs behaving in this way may provide a
 * mechanism to control whether sleeping mutexes can be interrupted. On OSs
 * that do not support the concept of interruption, \b or they do not support
 * control of mutex interruption, then interruptable mutexes may be treated
 * as non-interruptable.
 *
 * Some constrains apply to the lock type flags:
 *
 * - Spinlocks are by nature, non-interruptable. Hence, they must always be
 * combined with the NONINTERRUPTABLE flag, because it is meaningless to ask
 * for a spinlock that is interruptable (and this highlights its
 * non-interruptable-ness). For example, on certain OSs they should be used when
 * you must not sleep.
 * - Reader/writer is an optimization hint, and any type of lock can be
 * reader/writer. Since this is an optimization hint, the implementation need
 * not respect this for any/all types of lock. For example, on certain OSs,
 * there's no interruptable reader/writer mutex. If such a thing were requested
 * on that OS, the fact that interruptable was requested takes priority over the
 * reader/writer-ness, because reader/writer-ness is not necessary for correct
 * operation.
 * - Any lock can use the order parameter.
 * - A onelock is an optimization hint specific to certain OSs. It can be
 * specified when it is known that only one lock will be held by the thread,
 * and so can provide faster mutual exclusion. This can be safely ignored if
 * such optimization is not required/present.
 *
 * The absence of any flags (the value 0) results in a sleeping-mutex, which is interruptable.

/** @brief Cause a queued, deferred call of the work handler
 *
 * _mali_osk_wq_schedule_work provides a mechanism for enqueuing deferred calls
 * to the work handler. After calling \ref _mali_osk_wq_schedule_work(), the
 * work handler will be scheduled to run at some point in the future.
 *
 * Typically this is called by the IRQ upper-half to defer further processing of
 * IRQ-related work to the IRQ bottom-half handler. This is necessary for work
 * that cannot be done in an IRQ context by the IRQ upper-half handler. Timer
 * callbacks also use this mechanism, because they are treated as though they
 * operate in an IRQ context. Refer to \ref _mali_osk_timer_t for more
 * information.
 *
 * Code that operates in a kernel-process context (with no IRQ context
 * restrictions) may also enqueue deferred calls to the IRQ bottom-half. The
 * advantage over direct calling is that deferred calling allows the caller and
 * IRQ bottom half to hold the same mutex, with a guarantee that they will not
 * deadlock just by using this mechanism.
 *
 * _mali_osk_wq_schedule_work() places deferred call requests on a queue, to
 * allow for more than one thread to make a deferred call. Therfore, if it is
 * called 'K' times, then the IRQ bottom-half will be scheduled 'K' times too.
 * 'K' is a number that is implementation-specific.
 *
 * _mali_osk_wq_schedule_work() is guaranteed to not block on:
 * - enqueuing a deferred call request.
 * - the completion of the work handler.
 *
 * This is to prevent deadlock. For example, if _mali_osk_wq_schedule_work()
 * blocked, then it would cause a deadlock when the following two conditions
 * hold:
 * - The work handler callback (of type _mali_osk_wq_work_handler_t) locks
 * a mutex
 * - And, at the same time, the caller of _mali_osk_wq_schedule_work() also
 * holds the same mutex
 *
 * @note care must be taken to not overflow the queue that
 * _mali_osk_wq_schedule_work() operates on. Code must be structured to
 * ensure that the number of requests made to the queue is bounded. Otherwise,
 * work will be lost.
 *
 * The queue that _mali_osk_wq_schedule_work implements is a FIFO of N-writer,
 * 1-reader type. The writers are the callers of _mali_osk_wq_schedule_work
 * (all OSK-registered IRQ upper-half handlers in the system, watchdog timers,
 * callers from a Kernel-process context). The reader is a single thread that
 * handles all OSK-registered work.
 *
 * @param work a pointer to the _mali_osk_wq_work_t object corresponding to the
 * work to begin processing.
