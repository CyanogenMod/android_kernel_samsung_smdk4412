config MALI450
	bool "Enable Mali-450 support"
	depends on MALI400
	---help---
	  This enables support for Mali-450 specific features.

config MALI400_DEBUG
	bool "Enable debug in Mali driver"
	depends on MALI400
	---help---
	  This enabled extra debug checks and messages in the Mali driver.

config MALI400_PROFILING
	bool "Enable Mali profiling"
	depends on MALI400
	select TRACEPOINTS
	default y
	---help---
	  This enables gator profiling of Mali GPU events.

config MALI400_INTERNAL_PROFILING
	bool "Enable internal Mali profiling API"
	depends on MALI400_PROFILING
	default n
	---help---
	  This enables the internal legacy Mali profiling API.

config MALI400_UMP
	bool "Enable UMP support"
	depends on MALI400
	---help---
	  This enables support for the UMP memory sharing API in the Mali driver.

config MALI400_POWER_PERFORMANCE_POLICY
	bool "Enable Mali power performance policy"
	depends on ARM
	default n
	---help---
	  This enables support for dynamic performance scaling of Mali with the goal of lowering power consumption.

config MALI_DVFS
	bool "Enable mali DVFS"
	depends on MALI400 && PM_DEVFREQ
	default y
	---help---
		This enables Mali driver DVFS.

config MALI_DMA_BUF_MAP_ON_ATTACH
	bool "Map dma-buf attachments on attach"
	depends on MALI400 && DMA_SHARED_BUFFER
	default y
	---help---
	  This makes the Mali driver map dma-buf attachments after doing
	  attach. If this is not set the dma-buf attachments will be mapped for
	  every time the GPU need to access the buffer.

	  Mapping for each access can cause lower performance.

config MALI_SHARED_INTERRUPTS
	bool "Support for shared interrupts"
	depends on MALI400
	default n
	---help---
	  Adds functionality required to properly support shared interrupts.  Without this support,
	  the device driver will fail during insmod if it detects shared interrupts.  This also
	  works when the GPU is not using shared interrupts, but might have a slight performance
	  impact.

config MALI_PMU_PARALLEL_POWER_UP
	bool "Power up Mali PMU domains in parallel"
	depends on MALI400
	default n
	---help---
	  This makes the Mali driver power up all PMU power domains in parallel, instead of
	  powering up domains one by one, with a slight delay in between. Powering on all power
	  domains at the same time may cause peak currents higher than what some systems can handle.
	  These systems must not enable this option.
