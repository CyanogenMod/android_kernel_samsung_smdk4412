config ADIS16060
	tristate "Analog Devices ADIS16060 Yaw Rate Gyroscope with SPI driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices adis16060 wide bandwidth
	  yaw rate gyroscope with SPI.

config ADIS16080
	tristate "Analog Devices ADIS16080/100 Yaw Rate Gyroscope with SPI driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices adis16080/100 Yaw Rate
	  Gyroscope with SPI.

config ADIS16130
	tristate "Analog Devices ADIS16130 High Precision Angular Rate Sensor driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices ADIS16130 High Precision
	  Angular Rate Sensor driver.

config ADIS16260
	tristate "Analog Devices ADIS16260 Digital Gyroscope Sensor SPI driver"
	depends on SPI
	select IIO_TRIGGER if IIO_RING_BUFFER
	select IIO_SW_RING if IIO_RING_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices ADIS16260 ADIS16265
	  ADIS16250 ADIS16255 and ADIS16251 programmable digital gyroscope sensors.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called adis16260.

config ADXRS450
	tristate "Analog Devices ADXRS450 Digital Output Gyroscope SPI driver"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices ADXRS450 programmable
	  digital output gyroscope.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called adxrs450.

config K3G
	tristate "ST K3G gyroscope sensor"
	depends on I2C
	depends on IIO_RING_BUFFER
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for ST K3G gyroscope sensor. These devices use a hardware ring buffer.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called k3g.
