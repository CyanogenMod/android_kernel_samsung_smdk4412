config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  'ondemand' - This driver adds a dynamic cpufreq policy governor.
	  The governor does a periodic polling and 
	  changes frequency based on the CPU utilization.

	  do fast frequency switching (i.e, very low latency frequency
	  transitions).

	  Flexrate for 'ondemand' governor provides an interface to request
	  faster polling temporarily. This is to let it react quickly to
	  load changes when there is high probablity of load increase
	  in short time. For example, when a user event occurs, we have
	  use this interface. It does not increase the frequency
	  unconditionally; however, it allows ondemand to react fast
	  by temporarily decreasing sampling rate. Flexrate provides both
	  sysfs interface and in-kernel interface.

	  'interactive' - This driver adds a dynamic cpufreq policy governor

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_CONSERVATIVE
	tristate "'conservative' cpufreq governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  'conservative' - this driver is rather similar to the 'ondemand'
	  governor both in its source code and its purpose, the difference is
	  its optimisation for better suitability in a battery powered
	  environment.  The frequency is gracefully increased and decreased
	  rather than jumping to 100% when speed is required.

	  If you have a desktop machine then you should really be considering
	  the 'ondemand' governor instead, however if you are using a laptop,
	  PDA or even an AMD64 based computer (due to the unacceptable
	  step-by-step latency issues between the minimum and maximum frequency
	  transitions in the CPU) you will probably want to use this governor.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_conservative.

	  If in doubt, say N.
