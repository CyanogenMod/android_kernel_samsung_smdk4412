	  If you want ASoC support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your SoC platform below.
	  
	  ASoC provides power efficient ALSA support for embedded battery powered
	  SoC based systems like PDA's, Phones and Personal Media Players.

	  This ASoC audio support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called snd-soc-core.

config SND_SOC_CACHE_LZO
	bool "Support LZO compression for register caches"
	select LZO_COMPRESS
	select LZO_DECOMPRESS
	---help---
	   Select this to enable LZO compression for register caches.
	   This will allow machine or CODEC drivers to compress register
	   caches in memory, reducing the memory consumption at the
	   expense of performance.  If this is not present and is used
	   the system will fall back to uncompressed caches.

	   Usually it is safe to disable this option, where cache
	   compression in used the rbtree option will typically perform
	   better.
