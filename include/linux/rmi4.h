 * @level_triggered - by default, the driver uses edge triggered interrupts.
 * However, this can cause problems with suspend/resume on some platforms.  In

 * sensors will be defaulted.
 * @f11_rezero_wait - if non-zero, this is how may milliseconds the F11 2D
 * sensor(s) will wait before being be rezeroed on exit from suspend.  If
 * this value is zero, the F11 2D sensor(s) will not be rezeroed on resume.
 * @pre_suspend - this will be called before any other suspend operations are
 * done.
 * @power_management - overrides default touch sensor doze mode settings (see

 * during the suspend process.
 * @pre_resume - this is called before any other resume operations.  If you
